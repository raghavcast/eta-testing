# eta-testing
The eta_compute directory is the main directory that is being worked on \
Make sure to put the data folder in the root of the directory, if there is no data folder contact Raghav \


The vector_based subdirectory holds previous working files. \
amnex-live-data-server.py is Piyush's code taken directly from python-proxy. \
piyush_implementation.py is the implementation combining Piyush's implementation with mine. \
nikith_implementation.py is the implementation created by Nikith.


Check out my notes and thought process in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c0rL1AOjLoVbNIMeb2F76kQYWen7nlBg-jV5Mjxg3Pk/edit?tab=t.0). This works more like a journal so do not expect coherent notes.
